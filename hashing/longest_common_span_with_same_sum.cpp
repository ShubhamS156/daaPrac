/*
 * Subtract arr1 from arr2. We get 1s in arr1 as 1 and 1s in arr2 as -1 ..
 * then find the largest subarray with 0 sum in resultant array.
 * Length of this will be result as the number of 1s in arr1 and arr2 are equal as they
 * nullify to make 0 also and if 1s are equal for a given subarr the remaining numbers will
 * be 0. Hence same sum.
